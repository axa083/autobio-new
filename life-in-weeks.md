<p>My copy of Buster Benson's <a href="https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks"><b>'Life in Weeks'</b></a>. Each week of life is represented by a little box. Significant events get entered into each box, creating a way to reflect on the past, and to also observe the emptiness of the unfilled boxes.</p>
