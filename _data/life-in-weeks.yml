Other highlights include chocolate orange gelato, and hot churros. Such a cool city. San Sebastian was stunning, and, known for its food, delivered in the culinary area as well. I did a day trip solo to Biarritz via bus. I had the best fish of my life, courtesy of restaurant suggestion from Stephan, had delicious cake, and sat on the beach watching everything that went by. Scarily my return bus did not arrive, and with 4% battery, panic set in. A kind bus driver allowed me to board a different bus, and accepted payment back in San Sebastian."

    desc: "Lithuania (Vilnius and Kaunas) was nice. Lithuanians are seriously hospitable and intelligent. I met Alex in Helsinki which was exciting. Helsinki was dead, but we did a day trip to Tallinn via a huge ferry. The sun felt like it was setting at 2pm which was disorienting. Tallinn felt magical. Left a very expensive bottle of Dermalogica cleanser in Helsinki Airbnb."

    desc: "Bratislava had excellent Christmas market. Train to Vienna was pleasant, and quick. Vienna was large, and touristy. We ate at trendy middle eastern restaurant, Miznon, and despite checking allergens, Alex had a mild reaction to something. We spent the evening in the hotel watching football. Venturing across town the next day, we experienced the most delicious bagels, worth the 1 hour walk."

    desc: "Liverpool won my heart immediately. It had a palpable vibe and felt down to earth. Beatles bar was sensational, and the live musician was the best I'd ever seen. We had a day in Chester, which was nice and felt historic, and we did the walk to cross the Welsh border. I wondered what people in these smaller cities did for work."

  - name: "I went to Wales"
    desc: "An interesting trip to Wales. First, we stopped in Bath (so pretty). Then on we went to Cardiff for an evening. We saw Bannau Brycheiniog, (i.e. the Brecon Beacons), Pembrokeshire and Gower. Wales was stunning, however their roads need work. We hired an old VW campervan, which, to say the least, was a ticking timebomb. Manual, no power steering, poor lights (Are we on high beam or not...?). Frightening going up hills, and stressful. Stalled a lot, but it was the VW's fault. It conked out in Cardiff a few kms away from our final destination."

    desc: "First time to Italy (and my first time driving on the right side of the road). We went to Verona first, which was a lovely city, then rented a car and drove all around Lake Garda, stopping for 2 nights in Costa. Mindbogglingly scary roads up the mountains. Feared for my life. Cost's food and hospitality was second to none, and an unforgettable Italian experience. We then drove back to Verona and boarded a train to Venice. A beautiful city, however over-crowded and overwhelming. Hard to find great food as the place is saturated with options. Brilliant gelato. As a bonus, the weather was amazing the entire time."
